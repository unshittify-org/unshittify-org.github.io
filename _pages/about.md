We are a two-person team working to reclaim our lives from enshittification, and documenting our work so you can do the same.

The unshittifying we do will be diverse - varying across scopes of time, resources needed, subject matters covered, goals, and motivations.  

On one end of the spectrum, you'll see how  fast and easy it was to switch from Twitter to Bluesky.  On the other end, you'll get periodic updates on our already-months-long process of eliminating our reliance on Amazon products, and extricating our data from their ecosystem.

We want a more equitable world, where knowledge and wellbeing are shared, and where we can control our own data and privacy.  You can get more information at the links below about our goals for this project and the world, how we evaluate the products and companies we're switching to, and how to use this website.
