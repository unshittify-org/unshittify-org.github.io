The Outhouse is where you can find a full list of the sites, companies, services, and products that we consider enshittified.

In our household, we've been trying to Unshittify everything we can.  This list includes:

* What we've unshittified
* Some of what we intend to unshittify
* Some of what we would unshittify if we had the time and resources
* What we think other people may find valuable to unshittify

You can see our recommended alternatives[^1] at [The Good Shit](/good-shit/)!

[^1]: Note: Some items may appear in both The Outhouse *and* [The Good Shit](/good-shit). On the appropriate company and product pages, we will indicate in what ways we consider them Enshittified, and in what ways we consider them Good Shit.
