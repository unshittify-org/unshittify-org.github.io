  What does it mean to be enshittified? What policies, features, and protections are we looking for when we try to find alternatives? <br /><br />

## Our Priorities

We judge the products and services we use, recommend, and disrecommend based on compliance with the following priorities.

### Freely Shared and Freely Accessed {#priority-free}

The best defenses against enshittification are collaboration and open access. This means we prioritize supporting projects and products that are released openly and freely, or under licenses that encourage collaboration and access.

#### (F)OSS Software {#metrics-free-software}

Level 4 body

##### Test Level 5

Level 5 body

###### Test Level 6

Relevant to software.
"FOSS" refers to Free <sup>as in Speech, not Beer</sup> and/or Open-Source software.

| **Right To Repair Hardware** | Hardware is designed to be repairable by the user. All parts and tools required to repair the hardware are readily available and non-proprietary. Instructions for repairs are free and easily accessible. <br><br> Like data, hardware or the information needed to create the hardware yourself is in the public domain or is distributed under a Creative Commons license. | Hardware includes some proprietary parts which are available at reasonable prices, and which have alternatives available from vendors other than the original manufacturer. Hardware is mostly repairable, but may require equipment or tools that laypeople do not usually have. | Hardware is designed to not be repairable (e.g. parts are glued or welded), or designed to require specialty tools and equipment (e.g., brand-specific security screws). Repairs may only be performed by authorized repair facilities (e.g. unauthorized repairs void the device warranty), using proprietary parts (e.g. unregistered serial numbers on replacement parts lead to arbitrary features of the device being disabled). The owning company actively fights consumers' right to repair their hardware.|
